ISSUES WITH DATA STRUCTURE
    - synonyms
    - fem plural of how is same as fem sing so how do we make sure the answer and choices are correct
    - seperate from word,phrase,letter to noun,verb etc to enable choices that are more appropriate
    - gendered stuff
    - plural stuff
        - nouns are verbs have different use for it
        -guessing what nouns are masc or fem

question type
    - enable phrases
    - choices to questions should be affected by type

OPTIONS
    - whether to include phrases, words and letters

NICE TO HAVE
