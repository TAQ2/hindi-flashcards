Hindi

DEADLINE
- colour design is crap
- check other browsers
- check mobile
- update website
- Favicon


SEPERATE OUT WHAT IS REVISION AND WHAT IS COMPLETING THE PROJECT
typescript?
use redux? (there is a stash for it)
results component

add letters?
does it make sense to have hindi -> eng pronounce or vice versa
allow to practice phrases from a given class week? 


Readme needs more work - suggests we need to do some tests

ISSUES WITH DATA STRUCTURE
    - synonyms
    - fem plural of how is same as fem sing so how do we make sure the answer and choices are correct
    - seperate from word,phrase,letter to noun,verb etc to enable choices that are more appropriate
    - gendered stuff
    - plural stuff
        - nouns are verbs have different use for it
        -guessing what nouns are masc or fem

question type
    - enable phrases
    - choices to questions should be affected by type

OPTIONS
    - whether to include phrases, words and letters

NICE TO HAVE
- need another config otherwise it looks strange - perhaps use a timer?
- slider design
- progress bar of kinds?
explore embedding google translate
Option to type the word instead
Do we have a timer?
change the number of multiple choices to a question
can we get a hindi audio from google? or embed it for use?

TECH
tests
use typescript?
